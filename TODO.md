# TODO

Yes. I could use issues on GitHub or Trello or some other third party tool, but
considering this is only for myself it's easy to keep a list of stuff to do in
this file.

This is different from the `CHANGELOG`, that one is for end users and potential
packagers. This file is for devs and to keep track of the things I work on or
the things I want to work on at some point. The `Done` section may overlap with
`CHANGELOG`, for now I'll use it and change if needed in the future.

## In Progress

## TODO

2. test: Bind mount secrets and don't include in test image
3. test: Use stable test image and bind mount `forger`
4. test: Test configuration steps individually
5. feat(log): Eliminate sensitive info from logs

## Done

6. feat(sys): Add role for upgrading the system
1. chore(README): Write a better `README` file
7. refactor: Clean slate
